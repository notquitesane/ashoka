# Some minimal Mutt settings, Gentoo-style.  Since mutt was installed
# with USE=mbox, this file doesn't have any changes from the default
# mutt settings, making it very minimal indeed...
#
# Please don't add settings to this file to change other user
# preferences (such as colors), since those can be hard for a user to
# undo if their preference doesn't match yours!  For example, it is
# *impossible* currently in mutt to remove color settings from objects
# other than the index.

# mandatory attachments settings, not setting these is a BUG!
